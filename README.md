# REMARKS:

I no longer own a Canon Eos Camera. So, any bugs you find - and there are many - I am unable to fix.
If you want me to keep working on this project, feel free to sponsor or even lend me a camera.
I am willing to put more work into this but without a camera, this is not going to make any sense at all.

# Canon.Eos.Framework (Alpha Version) 

Canon.Eos.Framework tries to provide a better and more convenient way to integrate the [Canon EOS SDK](http://www.didp.canon-europa.com/) into .NET applications.
You still need to apply for and download the original SDK which includes all the DLLs.

## How to use it

See the included sample program for details.
